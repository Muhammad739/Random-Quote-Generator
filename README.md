# Random-Quote-Generator

1. first we have to create function for **random quote generator**.
2. we create an **Array** to store our quotes which we have to show randomly.
3. now we have to create loop to parse the whole array and select the quote randomly.
4. in loop we crate an index variable on which we use **Math.floor** method which roundof the value which we get form the the **Math.random** method and then multiplying it with the length of **quote** Array.
5. after cretaing index variable now we are returning the the random quote by passing quote and index value in the the quote bracket.
6. At the end we call the function.
